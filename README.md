# Commit Protocol

Each subteam (Frontend, Backend, 3D) has their own branch and consists of 2 members. Each person maintains their own personal branch when developing and pushes only to their subteam's branch. All merge conflicts must be resolved at this level before proceeding. 

To merge a subteam's branch into main, it requires approval from at least 1 representative from each of the other two teams.
